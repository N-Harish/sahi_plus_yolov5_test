# SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) for improving object detection and segmentation on small objects

* Here I've tried SAHI algorithm for person detection
* The algorithm is able to detect objects far away from camera effeciently


## code

* Run the following command
    ```
    python sahi_yolov5_test.py
    ```
* Replace link variable with the youtube video link to run inference on
